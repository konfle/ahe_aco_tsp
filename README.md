## Description

The aim of the project is to create a computer application that uses the ant algorithm to solve the problem of the 
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The travelling salesman problem consists of finding the shortest route, 
that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimising the total travel distance.

## Funkcje
- Implementation of the ant algorithm to solve the commuter problem.
- Finding the optimal route visiting all cities exactly once.
- Minimisation of the total distance travelled.
- Interactive interface for easy input of input data (cities, distances between them)
  and display of results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command (We recommend using a virtual environment):

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application by executing the following command from the main project directory:

    ```shell
    python .\app\app.py
    ```
